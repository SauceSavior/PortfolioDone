			<h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>A simple developer that is trying to learn the ways of programing. I'm fairly new to the field, but I'm a fast learner on a pursuit of knowledge. I've taken every opportunity that I could to get to where I am today, and I am willing to go farther down this path. I'm knowledgeable in a few languages such as python, HTML, JavaScript, and LUA. I have done some work with vim as well, and I am willing to learn more about it given the opportunity. </p>		</section>
